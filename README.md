# DataScience-Exploration
Worked with Taylor Fogarty Peter Worcester to analyze Spotify's Data Using Regression.

From Kaggle.com, we obtained this list for 2018 which included 13 variables such as tempo,
duration, acoustic-ness, and valence (positivity) for each song as well as identifiers 
(artist name, track id, and artist name). For our purposes, we ignored the identifiers in 
order to focus on the numeric qualities of the songs since we already know that Post Malone 
releases the greatest hits of this generation. Our main goal: find the most important factors 
in determining what makes one song more popular than another so we can predict how popular a 
new song may be. To do this, we used three different metrics for evaluating different linear models. 

We explore R-squared vs adjusted R-squared, Mean Sqaured Error and other error statistics, and alkaline and bayesian information criterion.
